<h1 align="center">Hi, it's Darren here 👋</h1>

It appears that you are looking at my GitHub profile. Yes, I'm looking at you over on the other side of the screen! 👀

## Fun things about me

🇬🇧&nbsp; Currently based in London, UK.

👨🏻‍💻&nbsp; Senior Software Engineer currently taking a break. Available for work from October 2023 at the earliest. Feel free to
get in touch via the social links below if you have a suitable role that will allow me to do some (if not all) of the following:
- Use some of the languages, tools and technologies mentioned below;
- Learn new things in combination with the above;
- Lead and architect a complex project;
- Mentor other engineers and/or be mentored - learning is a two-way street!
- Get involved in improving engineering processes.

🖥&nbsp; Languages, tools and technologies I currently enjoy working with: HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Jest,
React Testing Library, Cypress, GraphQL, Express, Docker, Python, Flask, MongoDB and SQL.

🛠&nbsp; Core contributor of [Couchers](https://couchers.org/), the new/upcoming online platform for couch-surfers.

👨🏻‍🏫&nbsp; Coding instructor/coach at Code First: Girls and codebar. Giving back to the tech community and making it a more
accessible and inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of their background, is a big passion of mine, as I believe
_the best_ software/products can only be built if our teams look like the users we build for.

🛫&nbsp; Spontaneous traveller — ranging from [mystery holidays](https://www.journeetrips.com/), last-minute weekend breaks
and cruises, you name it and I'll probably be there! 🚶‍♂️
