## Some fun things you should know about me

🇬🇧 Currently based in London, UK.

👨🏻‍💻 Software developer at Unmind, a mental health and wellbeing startup looking to encourage more open discussions
around the subject.

🖥 Languages, tools and technologies I enjoy working with: HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Jest, Cypress, GraphQL,
Express, Docker, Python, Flask, MongoDB and SQL.

👨🏻‍🏫 Coding instructor/coach at Code First: Girls and codebar. Giving back to the tech community and making it a more
accessible and inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of their background, is a big passion of mine, as I believe
*the best* software/products can only be built if our people looks like the users we build for.

🛫 Spontaneous traveller whenever it is safe to do so again... 😷 In the mean time, I stick to walks in parks and the block around
me 🚶🏻‍♂️
