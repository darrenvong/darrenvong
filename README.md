## Fun things about me

🇬🇧&nbsp; Currently based in London, UK.

React Testing Library, Cypress, GraphQL, Express, Docker, Python, Flask, MongoDB and SQL.

🛠&nbsp; Former core contributor of [Couchers](https://couchers.org/) - a new, open-sourced online platform for couch-surfers.

🛫&nbsp; Spontaneous traveller — ranging from [mystery holidays](https://www.journeetrips.com/), last-minute weekend breaks
and cruises, you name it and I'll probably be there! 🚶‍♂️

🎭&nbsp; Improviser - Recently, I've been immersing myself into the world of improv through short-form games and longer scenes
to find joy beyond staring at screens!
