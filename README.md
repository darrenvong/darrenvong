<h1 align="center">Hi, it's Darren here 👋</h1>

It appears that you are looking at my GitHub profile. Yes, I'm looking at you over on the other side of the screen! 👀

## Fun things about me

🇬🇧&nbsp; Currently based in London, UK.

👨🏻‍💻&nbsp; Software developer at Unmind, a startup with a mission of building a platform for looking after our mental health
and wellbeing.

🖥&nbsp; Languages, tools and technologies I currently enjoy working with: HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Jest,
React Testing Library, Cypress, GraphQL, Express, Docker, Python, Flask, MongoDB and SQL.

🛠&nbsp; Core contributor of [Couchers](https://couchers.org/), the new/upcoming online platform for couch-surfers.

👨🏻‍🏫&nbsp; Coding instructor/coach at Code First: Girls and codebar. Giving back to the tech community and making it a more
accessible and inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of their background, is a big passion of mine, as I believe
_the best_ software/products can only be built if our teams look like the users we build for.

🛫&nbsp; Spontaneous traveller whenever it is safe to do so again... 😷 &nbsp;In the mean time, I stick to walks in parks and the block around
me 🚶🏻‍♂️
